This repository contains codes (Jupyter notebooks and R codes) for reproducing the "main" analysis and results presented in the article 
"Ombadi et al., A warming-induced reduction in snow fraction amplifies rainfall extremes". These codes must be downloaded along with the data 
in the Zenodo repository at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7740037. The data files consists of sample input data and results files in a NetCDF format 
which is needed to run the codes in this repository either to reproduce the results or for demonstration purposes.

Please note that this is a pre-release version. The codes will be updated with more details in the near future.
